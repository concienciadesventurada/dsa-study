In the exercise, the value of k represents the length of the sublists into
which the original array is divided. The goal is to analyze the performance
of the modified algorithm that uses insertion sort for sorting these sublists.

Let's go through each question:

a. To show that insertion sort can sort the n/k sublists, each of length k, in
Θ(nk) worst-case time, you can use the same reasoning as the standard insertion
sort analysis. Since each sublist has length k, the worst-case time complexity of
sorting each sublist individually is Θ(k^2). Since there are n/k sublists, the
overall worst-case time complexity for sorting all sublists is Θ((n/k) \* k^2) = Θ(nk).

b. The merging of the sublists can be done in Θ(n lg(n/k)) worst-case time. 
This can be achieved by applying the merge operation recursively on pairs of sublists
until all sublists are merged into a single sorted array. Since there are n/k sublists,
the number of recursive merge operations needed is lg(n/k). Each merge operation takes
Θ(n) time. Therefore, the overall worst-case time complexity for merging the sublists
is Θ(n lg(n/k)).

c. The modified algorithm has the same running time as the standard merge sort when
nk C n lg(n/k) = n lg n. Here, C represents some constant factor. By simplifying the
equation, you can determine the largest value of k that satisfies the equation. This
allows you to compare the running time of the modified algorithm with the standard
merge sort in terms of Θ-notation.

d. The choice of k in practice depends on various factors such as the characteristics
of the input data, the specific implementation, and the hardware architecture.
In general, it is recommended to perform empirical analysis or benchmarking on
different values of k to determine the optimal value for a given scenario. The optimal
value of k may vary depending on the input size and the machine architecture.
In your case, you chose k = 50 as an arbitrary value, but it may not be the optimal
choice for all cases.

To further optimize the algorithm, you could experiment with different values of k and
measure the actual running time for various input sizes. This will help you identify the
value of k that provides the best performance for your specific use case.
