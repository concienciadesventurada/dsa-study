### Introduction to algorithms and Data Structures

An in depth reading of the book written by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.

My main goal is to read it front-to-back, completing the exercises and getting a
good grasp on DSAs.

All implementations will be written mainly in TypeScript, however, I may use other
languages if they are more appropiate or easer to get what they are __actually__
doing: for example, write a Linked List in C since given the conditions of the
language they are so trivial and barebones.

#### Resources used

I plan to add the videos, chapters and web pages I query whenever I'm learning any
of these topics and link them, so it would work as a guide for myself and other people
who learn in a rather heterodox manner.

- [**Big O**](https://big-o.io/): A great general overview in different languages
the computing complexity of some of the most known sorting algorithms

##### Insertion sort

The first algorithm tackled by the book:

- [**Ordenamiento por Inserci√≥n | Insertion sort by Chio Code**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GU6AGEWYJY)
- [**Insertion Sort in Big-O.io**](https://big-o.io/algorithms/comparison/insertion-sort/)
