## Introduction to algorithms and Data Structures

An in depth reading of the book written by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.

My main goal is to read it front-to-back, completing the exercises and getting a
good grasp on DSAs.

All implementations will be written mainly in TypeScript, however, I may use other
languages if they are more appropriate or easier to get what they are __actually__
doing: for example, write a Linked List in C since given the conditions of the
language they are so trivial and bare-bones.

## Resources used

I plan to add the videos, chapters and web pages I query whenever I'm learning any
of these topics and link them, so it would work as a guide for myself and other people
who learn in a rather heterodox manner.

- [**Big O**](https://big-o.io/): A great general overview in different languages
the computing complexity of some of the most known sorting algorithms

### Insertion sort

The first algorithm tackled by the book:

- [**Insertion Sort in Big-O.io**](https://big-o.io/algorithms/comparison/insertion-sort/)

### Merge sort

The second algorithm presented by the book to illustrate different use cases and
also to later demonstrate how one can be used an be complemented by the other.
This one, far more complex in comparison due to its recursive foundation was a
lot harder to grasp, however, eventually makes... kinda sense? I swear it's not THAT hard
